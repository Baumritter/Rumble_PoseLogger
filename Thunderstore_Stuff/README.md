## Overview
The Mod tracks what poses are being done by the player and writes that info into the console/a file.
Additionally the time between the latest and current pose is being tracked as to give info on the execution speed of the player.

## Controls and Other Functions
- The Logging can be turned Off/On (Default is ON) using the "L" key with the main window of the game selected.
- The Logging does only work in the park and in the gym (main hub).
- After 1500ms of no pose the logging will produce a spacer to make readability better.
- Console/File Logging can be enabled/disabled via the Settings File in "Userdata\PoseLogger\Settings\Setting.txt".

## Known Issues
- The delay tracking of repeated Sprint Poses is inaccurate.
- The Pose tracking will only track the host of the park
